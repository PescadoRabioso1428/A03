Glossary:

Branch - A set of code that is under development without affecting the porduction / main branch code

Clone - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

Commit - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

Fetch - When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

GIT - Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.

Github - GitHub Apps provide a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories.

Merge - Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.

Merge Conflict - A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. 

Push - To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.

Pull - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

Remote - This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

Repository - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.
